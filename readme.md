# QuranType

I started this project for 2 main reasons:
- I wanted to read and memorise more Quran
- I wanted to improve my arabic (reading, spelling, writing, typing)

The inspiration for this idea comes from a practise that is prevent in my culture for kids at a young age: writing parts of the Quran they are currently studying/memorising. The idea behind this is to improve the kids' arabic writing skills, make them more familiar and comfortable with the Quran, as well as drilling it into their memory for easier memorisation. I saw it with my younger brother, and thought why not create a similar thing, but instead, have the focus be on typing instead of writing.

I will admit that my connection with physical mediums has dropped significantly over the last couple of years, and I mainly use a laptop and phone for everything from taking notes, to reading, and much more. While this has many positives, I recognise that it isn't for everyone, and that it definitely has drawbacks. This site is not made for everyone wanting to read the Quran, but for the niche minority that like me, prefer this digital medium, and want to improve their arabic and Quran knowledge in this way.
