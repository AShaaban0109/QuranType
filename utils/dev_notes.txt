TODO
figure out a way to not have to use the global currentLetterIndex variable.
refactor input and the other button to make them nicer

fix bug with last ya here. it only accept ي and doesnt work with any ى
قل أعوذ برب الناس ملك الناس إلاه الناس من شر الوسواس الخناس ااذي 

// fix an issue with the ya encoding 
    // (persian for some reason). Note this replaces all normal ya, but also the ya for alef layena.
    //  so for something like فى it is written في. Not sure if this is fine, check with someone arabic literate.

look at the whole tashkeel part again.


sort out bug when when press button then type from the middle of the word it doesnt work
it only works from the start of the word. should be a simple index update

can maybe make the animation smoother?

maybe add some feature or popup or smth when all the words in the final row have been finished

add surah name search
